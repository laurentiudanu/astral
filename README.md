Realtime inspector/editor functionality. This is the framework in its most recent state.

Netcode is coming along well. This also shows a Chromium wrapper being used to launch the game like a native Windows app.

After a long hiatus, I returned to this project to continue where I left off, but I wanted to rewrite the code from the ground up and apply what I learned from the previous prototypes. This time around, I tackled the netcode first, so that a client/server model would be part of the core from the very beginning, without having to overhaul a single player engine into a multiplayer one later.

Once I had a prototype canvas engine working I decided to take things to the next level by doing the Breakouts project and carrying over the inspector/editor ideas from the previous work.

Testing object collisions, sorting, and shadows. Started adding an inspector/editor thing.

Very early prototype testing out sprite animations and roaming AI to see what's possible with HTML5 canvas. Apologies for the poor GIF, the file was large so it got doinked.
